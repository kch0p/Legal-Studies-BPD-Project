    "The initial part of this project was just spent merging the two police stop datasets (2015-2020, 60k obs) (2020-2022, 8k obs) and re-classifying certain columns to match like citation code, reason for stop, race, datetime, etc. I later found a .geojson file containing the geometries for census tracts in the city of berkeley, as well as searched the census website and produced/organized sheets with the 2020 racial compositions and income data for all 31 census tracts. \n",

I finalized the .geojson by finding a list of all of the schools in berkeley and adding them as minimally classified markers. These were also used in the final visualizations. \n",

Methods for this could range from linear regression to modelling, and possibly z-testing. We can also do a binomial logistic regression on if an arrest occured or not, and see what the odds of this are given the race of the person being stopped. I'm very interested in seeing if the odds differ by race, or even by census tract. \n",

I may submit a request now and see if I merge this data down the line, but for now we're limited to stops. Even with my minimal analysis so far though, I think we'll still be able to make some decent comparisions within our data.\n",

    "So far I've created three main visualizations: one choropleth map that demonstrates amount of stops by census tract, one heatmap that shows stop patterns in general and also contains tract info, and a circle map that shows the more precise location of crimes both within tracts and in berkeley overall. Each is uniquely valuable in getting a look at the data, particularly in that I've created layer controls so that you can view the maps in different tile formats, and also in that I've taken the merged census data for income/racial composition in all of the tracts and made them visible in the maps as well. I'm really proud of the interactivity and am excited to see how we can develop these more as the project continues. \n",

    "An immediate observation from working with the data (with emphasis on the heat map) is that distance from the university doesn't actually have a directly positive relationship with number of stops. I'm guessing now that it may have some curvilinear relationship - that it's not necessarily how far you are from the university, but rather if you are CLOSE or FAR from it instead. Notably there have also been a few concentrations of stops surrounding some of the elementary school pins. I'm excited to see if these are traffic stops related to school zone speed limits, or if they have to do with something else. \n",
