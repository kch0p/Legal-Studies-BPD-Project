This is an analysis of BPD stops since their RIPA Compliance Update in 2020! This continues some of the kinds of [analysis done by The Center for Policing Equity](https://www.berkeleyside.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Berkeley-Report-May-2018.pdf) and their work on BPD in 2018 on stop and crime data from 2012-2016. 

Our data includes non-RIPA-compliant ([more information here](https://oag.ca.gov/ab953)) stop data from 2015-2020, and RIPA-compliant data from 2015-2022. Both datasets are publicly available through the city's [open data portal](https://data.cityofberkeley.info/). The analysis covers the effects of percieved race prior to stop on result of stop, the most common kinds of stop results, causes for extended stop durations,  differences in stop rates between white, african american, and hispanic populations, and more.
